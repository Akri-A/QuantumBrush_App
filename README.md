# Quantum Brush

A modern, open-source desktop application for quantum-powered digital art. Quantum Brush lets you paint with brushes driven by real quantum computing algorithms — from Heisenberg spin models to quantum cellular automata — producing visual effects that are impossible with classical computation alone.

This project is a complete rewrite of the original [Quantum Brush](https://github.com/moth-quantum/QuantumBrush) by [MOTH Quantum](https://github.com/moth-quantum), rebuilt from the ground up with a modern tech stack while preserving and extending the original quantum effect engine.

## Quantum Brushes & Effects

Each effect runs a real quantum algorithm on the pixel data. Effects are dynamically loaded as plugins from the `python/` directory.

### 1. Basic (Acrylic)
**Author:** MOTH
Paints a uniform color on the canvas. The non-quantum baseline brush with configurable radius, color, opacity, and edge blur.

### 2. Smudge (Damping)
**Author:** Joao
Mixes colors using **quantum amplitude damping/pumping channels**. Each stroke segment is encoded as a qubit state, evolved through controlled rotation gates simulating energy exchange, and decoded back into shifted HLS colors.

### 3. Collage (Clone)
**Author:** Joao
Copies and pastes image regions subject to the **quantum no-cloning theorem**. Uses an asymmetric universal cloning circuit to produce two imperfect copies — the fidelity trade-off is governed by quantum mechanics.

### 4. Aquarela (QDrop)
**Author:** Joao
A watercolor brush that mixes a target color with canvas colors using **quantum entanglement**. Controlled rotations entangle paint drops with an ancilla qubit, producing non-classical color correlations.

### 5. Heisenbrush (Continuous)
**Author:** Arianna
Simulates color shifts through the **Heisenberg spin model**. A chain of qubits evolves under the Heisenberg Hamiltonian (XX + YY + ZZ interactions), and mean magnetization measurements drive smooth color transformations along the stroke.

### 6. Heisenbrush (Discrete)
**Author:** Arianna
Multi-stroke variant of the Heisenbrush. Each stroke segment independently evolves through the **Heisenberg model**, producing discrete, physics-inspired color variations. Limited to 10 strokes.

### 7. Game of Life (GoL)
**Author:** Daniel
A **quantum cellular automaton** inspired by Conway's Game of Life. Each pixel's color is encoded as a qubit and evolved through a 9-qubit neighbourhood circuit. The reduced density matrix determines the new color via partial trace.

### 8. Chemical
**Authors:** Ali, Henrique Ennes & Jui-Ting Lu (Luminists)
Uses intermediate steps of the **Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)** to simulate H2 molecules. Pre-computed VQE circuits transform pixel colors, mapping molecular ground-state optimization onto visual effects.

### 9. Quantum Pointillism
**Authors:** Khrystian Koci & Benjamin Thomas
Places dots along the stroke path with quantum-correlated colors via the **Ising model**. Trotterized time evolution creates correlations between neighbouring dots — ferromagnetic (similar) or antiferromagnetic (contrasting).

### 10. Steerable
**Authors:** Chih-Kang Huang & Jui-Ting Lu (Luminists)
Applies **quantum geometric control theory** to steer one image region's colors toward another. A PennyLane circuit is trained via JAX optimization to find the unitary transformation between source and target states.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 18
- **Python** >= 3.9
- **npm**

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Akri-A/QuantumBrush_App.git
cd QuantumBrush_App
```

### Install Frontend Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install numpy pillow qiskit qiskit-aer scipy pennylane jax
```

> The app checks for missing Python packages on startup and will notify you if any are missing.

### Run in Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts Vite's dev server with hot module replacement and launches the Electron window.

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This compiles TypeScript, bundles with Vite, and packages the desktop app with Electron Builder. Output targets:

- **macOS** — `.dmg`
- **Windows** — NSIS installer (x64)
- **Linux** — AppImage
