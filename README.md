## Usage Instruction
This application is tested with MacOS Sequoia (15.5) && Eclipse IDE (2025-03) && Python 3.11+ && OpenJDK 21.0.7 LTS. Technically, the application must support every machines (Windows, Linux and MacOS) with the suitable Java and Python versions. It requires OpenJDK and Python to execute, so they must be previously installed.

However, Luckily, the installer provides automatic OpenJDK + Python installation through `miniconda` thus you actually don’t need to do anything! `install.sh` creates condo environment `’quantumbrush’` and store all necessary libraries there. More of this is described under [Installation Instructions](https://github.com/moth-quantum/quantum-brush-collab?tab=readme-ov-file#instllation-instruction).
